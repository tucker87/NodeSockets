Create server.js with some sample code.
Setup launch.js for attached debugging and single click server startup.

Lookup a WebSocket package. Chose "WS"
npm install --save ws

Add some same code to the server.js
Create index.html with a script tag with some of the sample code a button to fire off that code.

Sample code calls "require" so I need to roll up my dependencies.
Chose "browserify" to perfrom this task.

Moved JS code out websockets.js

browserify websockets.js > bundle.js
Failed due to optional dependencies
npm install --save bufferutil
npm install --save utf-8-validate
browserify websockets.js > bundle.js (Again)

bundle.js is now 2MB :o

Pointed index.html to the bundle.js

Need to serve up my HTML from my server to XSS reasons.
Installing express to allow for more advanced html serving.
npm install express --save
npm install express-handlebars --save

Took some setup but got it all working.

Moved my bundle.js into the new 'public' folder and redirected express to look there for files.

Needed the express-ws package

npm i express-ws --save

OMG IT WAS THE BROWSER SIDE!
